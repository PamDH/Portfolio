Pamela Harraway - QA Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Engineer Portfolio repository! This space highlights my experience in software quality assurance, showcasing various test cases, 
bug reports, and API testing collections to demonstrate my skills in manual and automated testing.

About Me
I am a Quality Assurance Engineer with 5+ years of experience in testing web, mobile, and backend systems. My expertise includes:

Manual and Automated Testing: Skilled in developing detailed test plans, executing test cases, and automating workflows using tools like Cypress and Postman.
API Testing: Experience testing RESTful APIs using Postman, ensuring that the system backend operates correctly and meets business requirements.
Cross-functional Collaboration: I work closely with developers, business analysts, and product owners to ensure software meets both functional and user-experience standards.

Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following sections:

1. Test Cases
Inside the test-cases/ folder, you will find a variety of test cases that I have written, including:

Functional Testing: Verifying that the system meets its functional requirements.
Regression Testing: Ensuring that changes or additions to the codebase have not introduced new bugs.
End-to-End Testing: Testing user flows from start to finish across the application.

2. Bug Reports
The bug-reports/ folder contains bug reports that document defects found during testing. Each report includes:

A detailed bug description.
Steps to reproduce.
Expected vs. Actual behavior.
Severity and priority.
