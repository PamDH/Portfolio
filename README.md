# Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Engineer Portfolio repository! This space highlights my experience in software quality assurance, showcasing various test cases, 
bug reports, and API testing collections to demonstrate my skills in manual and automated testing.

### About Me
I’m **Pamela Harraway**, a passionate QA Engineer with 5 years of experience ensuring high-quality software across various industries. My journey into QA began during my time as a teacher, where I managed multiple educational applications. As the go-to person for testing and identifying bugs, I worked closely with developers in my district. That’s when I discovered my love for QA, and after completing a bootcamp, I transitioned into a professional role.

At Diversociete, I honed my front-end testing skills, focusing on eCommerce applications while diving into database validation and API testing. Now, at Playball, I ensure the quality of sports tech applications, conducting thorough web and mobile testing. My expertise spans automation testing, API testing with Postman, and SQL validation using MySQL to ensure data integrity.

I pride myself on writing detailed test cases, managing defects, and actively contributing to Agile processes. With experience in tools like JIRA, Zephyr, and Qase.io, I thrive in fast-paced environments with tight release cycles, always ensuring software quality before it reaches users. I’m also skilled in collaborating with both onshore and offshore teams, and I bring a proactive approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement.
